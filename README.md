# Clustering-for-Blood-Transfusion-data
This project focuses on clustering blood donor data to identify patterns and insights for optimizing donor recruitment. The dataset includes features such as recency (time since last donation), frequency (number of donations), monetary (amount of blood donated), time (duration since last donation), and donation activity in March 2007.

Using the K-Prototypes algorithm, which handles both numerical and categorical data, we perform clustering to group similar donors. The results can help improve strategies for engaging and retaining blood donors.
